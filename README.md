# Algorithms Practice

This repository contains implementations of classic algorithms and data structures in Python.  
The goal is to study from multiple sources and build a personal reference library.

## 🔸 Structure

- Grouped by topic: sorting, searching, recursion, etc.
- Each file contains a reference to the book it was based on.
- Notes and progress tracking are included.

## 📚 Sources

- *Grokking Algorithms* by Aditya Bhargava
- *Algorithms Illuminated* by Tim Roughgarden
- *MIT OpenCourseWare / CLRS*

## ▶️ Run Example
